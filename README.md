# PROJET-CY-METEO
Welcome to the "Projet CY Meteo". Let me explain to you what it is. It is a programm that you can use to find the weather in different parts of FRANCE. 
There are mutltiple mod that you can use, such as -t 1, -t 2, -t 3, -w, -h, -m, -p 1, -p 2, -p 3 to know different things on the weather. You can also use -G, -F, -Q, -S, -A, -O to filter with a location, -d to filter by date and finally --tab, --avl, --abr, to add a certain filter mode.
One thing you need to know is that if you tap a different mode than those previously told, the programm will end and told you a message of error. 
You need to use -f with the name of the file you want to filter if you want the programm to run.
To run the code, simply verify that you have the rights to execute it using "chmod -u+x ProjetCYMeteo.sh" and once this is done just tap in your terminal "./ProjetCYMeteo.sh" with the mod that you want. For example you can tap "./ProjetCYMeteo.sh -f a.csv -G -t 1 -m".
